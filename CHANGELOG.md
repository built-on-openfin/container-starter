# Changelog

## October 2025

- [detect-usb-devices](./how-to/detect-usb-devices/README.md) - Updated Readme to provide more details around configuration and a code sample. Updated example so that it acts as a tool which can be run locally or through live launch which lets you connect to a device, get the required vendorId and productId and launch a window that can connect and log out information.
