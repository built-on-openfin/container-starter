				This is a basic window app to represent an external app issuing commands to a platform to launch a
				view. This app could be a java or a .net application as well as a web based application.
			</p>
			<p>The buttons below let you:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Launch a platform app and connect to the command channel</li>
				<li>Send a command to the platform to launch a view and pass some data</li>
				<li>
					Send a command to the platform to launch a view, pass some data and tell it to place the view near a
					specific window/view (in this case the last one launched)
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				When the platform is launched you will see the provider window show (it is generally hidden by
				default). Once shown you can issue the createView commands from this application.
