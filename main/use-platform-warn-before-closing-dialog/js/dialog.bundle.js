/**
 * Namespace for OpenFin event types. Each entity that emits OpenFin events has its own sub-namespace. Event payloads

 *
 * #### Event emitters
 *
 * The following entities emit OpenFin events, and have corresponding sub-namespaces:
 *
 * * {@link OpenFin.Application}: {@link OpenFin.ApplicationEvents}
 * * {@link OpenFin.ExternalApplication}: {@link OpenFin.ExternalApplicationEvents}
 * * {@link OpenFin.Frame}: {@link OpenFin.FrameEvents}
 * * {@link OpenFin.GlobalHotkey}: {@link OpenFin.GlobalHotkeyEvents}
 * * {@link OpenFin.Platform}: {@link OpenFin.PlatformEvents}
 * * {@link OpenFin.System}: {@link OpenFin.SystemEvents}
 * * {@link OpenFin.View}: {@link OpenFin.ViewEvents}
 * * {@link OpenFin.Window}: {@link OpenFin.WindowEvents}
 *
 * These `EventEmitter` entities share a common set of methods for interacting with the OpenFin event bus, which can be
 * seen on the individual documentation pages for each entity type.
 *
 * Registering event handlers is an asynchronous operation. It is important to ensure that the returned Promises are awaited to reduce the
 * risk of race conditions.
 *
 * When the `EventEmitter` receives an event from the browser process and emits on the renderer, all of the functions attached to that
 * specific event are called synchronously. Any values returned by the called listeners are ignored and will be discarded.  If the window document
 * is destroyed by page navigation or reload, its registered event listeners will be removed.
 *
 * We recommend using Arrow Functions for event listeners to ensure the this scope is consistent with the original function context.
 *
 * Events re-propagate from smaller/more-local scopes to larger/more-global scopes.  For example, an event emitted on a specific
 * view will propagate to the window in which the view is embedded, and then to the application in which the window is running, and
 * finally to the OpenFin runtime itself at the "system" level.  For details on propagation semantics, see the namespace for
 * the propagating (or propagated-to) entity.
 *
 * If you need the payload type for a specific type of event (especially propagated events), use the emitting topic's `Payload` generic
 * (e.g. {@link WindowEvents.Payload}) with the event's `type` string.  For example, the payload of
 * a {@link ViewEvents.CreatedEvent} after it has propagated to its parent {@link WindowEvents Window} can be found with
 * `WindowEvents.Payload<'view-created'>`.

 *
 * It is important to keep in mind that when an ordinary listener function is called, the standard `this` keyword is intentionally

 * then to the application as "window-view-shown", and finally at the system level as "application-window-view-shown".
 *
 * All event propagations are visible at the System level, regardless of source, so transitive re-propagations (e.g. from view to window
 * to application) are visible in their entirety at the system level.  So, we can listen to the above event as "shown", "view-shown",

     * });
     * ```
     *
     * Create a popup window as a modal:
     *
     * Note: The only way to ensure true modal behavior is to create the window being shown as a popup with a
     * `modalParentIdentity` that uses the caller view's parent window identity.
     *
     * ```js
     * const result = await fin.me.showPopupWindow({

     *     x: 0,
     *     y: 0
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * Pass data to a popup window that is available when the popup is shown.
     *
     * Note: this is just one example for a use of `additionalOptions`, it can be used to update any updatable
     * window options when creating or showing an existing window as a popup.

     * This api has an enhanced permission set to make it less dangerous. So application owners can only allow to launch the
     * assets owned by the application, the enabled downloaded files or the restricted executables.
     *
     * **Note:** Since _appAssets_ relies on the RVM, which is missing on MAC_OS, 'alias' is not available. Instead provide
     * the full path e.g. _/Applications/Calculator.app/Contents/MacOS/Calculator_.
     *
     * @example
     * Basic Example:
     * ```js
     * fin.System.launchExternalProcess({
     *     path: 'notepad',
     *     arguments: '',
     *     listener: function (result) {

     *     }
     * }).then(processIdentity => {
     *     console.log(processIdentity);
     * }).catch(error => {
     *     console.log(error);
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * Promise resolution:
     *
     * ```js
     * //This response has the following shape:
     * {
     *     uuid: "FB3E6E36-0976-4C2B-9A09-FB2E54D2F1BB" // The mapped UUID which identifies the launched process
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * Listener callback:
     * ```js
     * //This response has the following shape:
     * {
     *     topic: "exited", // Or "released" on a call to releaseExternalProcess
     *     uuid: "FB3E6E36-0976-4C2B-9A09-FB2E54D2F1BB", // The mapped UUID which identifies the launched process
     *     exitCode: 0 // Process exit code
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * By specifying a lifetime, an external process can live as long the window/application that launched it or
     * persist after the application exits. The default value is null, which is equivalent to 'persist', meaning
     * the process lives on after the application exits:
     *
     * ```js
     * fin.System.launchExternalProcess({
     *     path: 'notepad',
     *     arguments: '',
     *     listener: (result) => {
     *         console.log('the exit code', result.exitCode);
     *     },
     *     lifetime: 'window'
     * }).then(processIdentity => {
     *     console.log(processIdentity);
     * }).catch(error => {
     *     console.log(error);
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * Note: A process that exits when the window/application exits cannot be released via fin.desktop.System.releaseExternalProcess.
     *
     * By specifying a cwd, it will set current working directory when launching an external process:
     *
     * ```js
     * fin.System.launchExternalProcess({
     *     path: 'cmd.exe',
     *     cwd: 'c:\\temp',
     *     arguments: '',
     *     listener: (result) => {
     *         console.log('the exit code', result.exitCode);
     *     }
     * }).then(processIdentity => {
     *     console.log(processIdentity);
     * }).catch(error => {
     *     console.log(error);
     * });
     * ```
     *

     * ]
     * ```
     *
     * ```js
     * //  When called, if no arguments are passed then the arguments (if any)
     * //  are taken from the 'app.json' file, from the  'args' parameter
     * //  of the 'appAssets' Object with the relevant 'alias'.
     * fin.System.launchExternalProcess({
     *     //Additionally note that the executable found in the zip file specified in appAssets
     *     //will default to the one mentioned by appAssets.target
     *     //If the the path below refers to a specific path it will override this default
     *     alias: 'myApp',
     *     listener: (result) => {
     *         console.log('the exit code', result.exitCode);
     *     }
     * }).then(processIdentity => {
     *     console.log(processIdentity);
     * }).catch(error => {
     *     console.log(error);
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * Example using an alias but overriding the arguments:
     *
     * ```json
     * "appAssets": [
     *     {
     *         "src": "exe.zip",

     *         "target": "myApp.exe",
     *         "args": "a b c d"
     *     },
     * ]
     * ```
     *
     * ```js
     * //  If 'arguments' is passed as a parameter it takes precedence
     * //  over any 'args' set in the 'app.json'.
     * fin.System.launchExternalProcess({
     *     alias: 'myApp',
     *     arguments: 'e f g',
     *     listener: (result) => {
     *         console.log('the exit code', result.exitCode);
     *     }
     * }).then(processIdentity => {
     *     console.log(processIdentity);
     * }).catch(error => {
     *     console.log(error);
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * It is now possible to optionally perform any combination of the following certificate checks
     * against an absolute target via `fin.desktop.System.launchExternalProcess()`:
     *
     * ```js
     * "certificate": {
     *     "serial": "3c a5 ...",                        // A hex string with or without spaces
     *     "subject": "O=OpenFin INC., L=New York, ...", // An internally tokenized and comma delimited string allowing partial or full checks of the subject fields
     *     "publickey": "3c a5 ...",                     // A hex string with or without spaces
     *     "thumbprint": "3c a5 ...",                    // A hex string with or without spaces
     *     "trusted": true                               // A boolean indicating that the certificate is trusted and not revoked
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * Providing this information as part of the default configurations for assets in an application's manifest
     * will be added in a future RVM update:
     *
     * ```js
     * fin.System.launchExternalProcess({
     *     path: 'C:\\Users\\ExampleUser\\AppData\\Local\\OpenFin\\OpenFinRVM.exe',
     *     arguments: '--version',
     *     certificate: {
     *         trusted: true,
     *         subject: 'O=OpenFin INC., L=New York, S=NY, C=US',
     *         thumbprint: '‎3c a5 28 19 83 05 fe 69 88 e6 8f 4b 3a af c5 c5 1b 07 80 5b'
     *     },
     *     listener: (result) => {
     *         console.log('the exit code', result.exitCode);
     *     }
     * }).then(processIdentity => {
     *     console.log(processIdentity);
     * }).catch(error => {
     *     console.log(error);
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * It is possible to launch files that have been downloaded by the user by listening to the window
     * `file-download-completed` event and using the `fileUuid` provided by the event:
     *
     * ```js
     * const win = fin.Window.getCurrentSync();
     * win.addListener('file-download-completed', (evt) => {
     *     if (evt.state === 'completed') {
     *         fin.System.launchExternalProcess({
     *             fileUuid: evt.fileUuid,
     *             arguments: '',
     *             listener: (result) => {
     *                 console.log('the exit code', result.exitCode);
     *             }
     *         }).then(processIdentity => {
     *             console.log(processIdentity);
     *         }).catch(error => {
     *             console.log(error);
     *         });
     *     }
     * });
     * ```

 * An iframe represents an embedded HTML page within a parent HTML page. Because this embedded page

 * on if it is considered out of the root domain or not), it represents a unique endpoint as an OpenFin
 * connection. Iframes may be generated dynamically, or be present on initial page load and each non-CORS
 * iframe has the OpenFin API injected by default. It is possible to opt into cross-origin iframes having
 * the API by setting api.iframe.crossOriginInjection to true in a window's options. To block all iframes
 * from getting the API injected you can set api.frame.sameOriginInjection
 * to false <a href="Window.html#~options" target="_blank">({@link OpenFin.WindowCreationOptions see Window Options})</a>.
 *
 * To be able to directly address this context for eventing and messaging purposes, it needs a
 * unique uuid name pairing. For OpenFin applications and windows this is provided via a configuration
 * object in the form of a manifest URL or options object, but there is no configuration object for iframes.
 * Just as a call to window.open outside of our Window API returns a new window with a random GUID assigned
 * for the name, each iframe that has the API injected will be assigned a GUID as its name, the UUID will be
 * the same as the parent window's.
 *
 * The fin.Frame namespace represents a way to interact with `iframes` and facilitates the discovery of current context
 * (iframe or main window) as well as the ability to listen for {@link OpenFin.FrameEvents frame-specific events}.

     * Creates a new Window.
     * @param options Window creation options
     *
     * @remarks There are two Window types at your disposal while using OpenFin Platforms - Default Window and Custom Window.
     *
     * The Default Window uses the standard OpenFin Window UI. It contains the standard close, maximize and minimize buttons,
     * and will automatically render the Window's layout if one is specified.
     *
     * For deeper customization, you can bring your own Window code into a Platform. This is called a Custom Window.
     *
     * @example
     *
     *
     * The example below will create a Default Window which uses OpenFin default Window UI.<br>
     * The Window contains two Views in a stack Layout:
     *
     * ```js
     * const platform = fin.Platform.getCurrentSync();
     * platform.createWindow({
     *     layout: {
     *         content: [
     *             {
     *                 type: 'stack',
     *                 content: [
     *                     {
     *                         type: 'component',
     *                         componentName: 'view',
     *                         componentState: {
     *                             name: 'test_view_1',
     *                             url: 'https://cdn.openfin.co/docs/javascript/canary/Platform.html'
     *                         }
     *                     },
     *                     {
     *                         type: 'component',
     *                         componentName: 'view',
     *                         componentState: {
     *                             name: 'test_view_2',
     *                             url: 'https://cdn.openfin.co/docs/javascript/canary/Platform.html'
     *                         }
     *                     }
     *                 ]
     *             }
     *         ]
     *     }
     * }).then(console.log);
     * ```
     * The Default Window's design can be customized by specifying the `stylesheetUrl` property in the manifest:
     *
     * ```json
     * {
     *     platform: {
     *         defaultWindowOptions: {
     *             stylesheetUrl: 'some-url.css',
     *             ...
     *         }
     *     }
     * }
     * ```
     * For a list of common Layout CSS classes you can override in your custom stylesheet, see <a href="tutorial-layoutStyles.html">Useful Layout CSS Classes</a>
     **
     * To specify a Platform Custom Window, provide a `url` property when creating a Window.
     * If you intend to render a Layout in your Custom Window, you must also specify an `HTMLElement` that the Layout will inject into and set its `id` property to `"layout-container"`.
     *
     * The example below will create a Platform Custom Window:
     *
     * ```js
     *     // in an OpenFin app:
     *     const platform = fin.Platform.getCurrentSync();
     *     const windowConfig =
     *         {
     *             url: "https://www.my-domain.com/my-custom-window.html", // here we point to where the Custom Frame is hosted.
     *             layout: {
     *                 content: [
     *                     {
     *                         type: "stack",
     *                         content: [
     *                             {
     *                                 type: "component",
     *                                 componentName: "view",
     *                                 componentState: {
     *                                     name: "app #1",
     *                                     url: "https://cdn.openfin.co/docs/javascript/canary/Platform.html"
     *                                 }
     *                             },
     *                             {
     *                                 type: "component",
     *                                 componentName: "view",
     *                                 componentState: {
     *                                     name: "app #2",
     *                                     url: "https://cdn.openfin.co/docs/javascript/canary/Platform.html"
     *                                 }
     *                             }
     *                         ]
     *                     }
     *                 ]
     *             }
     *         };
     *     platform.createWindow(windowConfig);
     * ```
     *
     * Here's an example of a minimalist Custom Platform Window implementation:
     * ```html
     * <html>
     *     <head>
     *         <meta charset="utf-8">
     *         <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
     *         <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./styles.css">
     *     </head>
     *     <body>
     *         <div id="of-frame-main">
     *             <div id="title-bar">
     *                 <div class="title-bar-draggable">
     *                     <div id="title"> This is a custom frame! </div>
     *                 </div>
     *                 <div id="buttons-wrapper">
     *                     <div class="button" id="minimize-button"></div>
     *                     <div class="button" id="expand-button"></div>
     *                     <div class="button" id="close-button"></div>
     *                 </div>
     *             </div>
     *             <div id="layout-container"></div> <!-- OpenFin layout would be injected here -->
     *             <script src="./custom-frame.js"></script>
     *         </div>
     *     </body>
     * </html>
     * ```
     * Your Custom Window can use in-domain resources for further customization (such as CSS, scripts, etc.).<br>
     * For a list of common Layout CSS classes you can override in your stylesheet, see <a href="tutorial-layoutStyles.html">Useful Layout CSS Classes</a>
     *
     * The example above will require the `body` element to have `height: 100%;` set in order to render the layout correctly.

/**
 *
 * Layouts give app providers the ability to embed multiple views in a single window. The Layout namespace
 * enables the initialization and manipulation of a window's Layout. A Layout will
 * emit events locally on the DOM element representing the layout-container.
 *
 *
 * ### Layout.DOMEvents
 *
 * When a Layout is created, it emits events onto the DOM element representing the Layout container.
 * This Layout container is the DOM element referenced by containerId in {@link Layout.LayoutModule#init Layout.init}.
 * You can use the built-in event emitter to listen to these events using [addEventListener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener).
 * The events are emitted synchronously and only in the process where the Layout exists.
 * Any values returned by the called listeners are ignored and will be discarded.
 * If the target DOM element is destroyed, any events that have been set up on that element will be destroyed.
 *
 * @remarks The built-in event emitter is not an OpenFin event emitter so it doesn't share propagation semantics.
 *
 * #### {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener addEventListener(type, listener [, options]);}
 * Adds a listener to the end of the listeners array for the specified event.
 * @example
 * ```js
 * const myLayoutContainer = document.getElementById('layout-container');
 *
 * myLayoutContainer.addEventListener('tab-created', function(event) {
 *      const { tabSelector } = event.detail;
 *      const tabElement = document.getElementById(tabSelector);
 *      const existingColor = tabElement.style.backgroundColor;
 *      tabElement.style.backgroundColor = "red";
 *      setTimeout(() => {
 *          tabElement.style.backgroundColor = existingColor;
 *      }, 2000);
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * #### {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/removeEventListener removeEventListener(type, listener [, options]);}
 * Adds a listener to the end of the listeners array for the specified event.
 * @example
 * ```js
 * const myLayoutContainer = document.getElementById('layout-container');
 *
 * const listener = function(event) {
 *     console.log(event.detail);
 *     console.log('container-created event fired once, removing listener');
 *     myLayoutContainer.removeEventListener('container-created', listener);
 * };
 *
 * myLayoutContainer.addEventListener('container-created', listener);
 * ```
 *
 * ### Supported event types are:
 *
 * * tab-created
 * * container-created
 * * layout-state-changed
 * * tab-closed
 * * tab-dropped
 *
 * ### Layout DOM Node Events
 *
 * #### tab-created
 * Generated when a tab is created.  As a user drags and drops tabs within window, new tabs are created.  A single view may have multiple tabs created and destroyed during its lifetime attached to a single window.
 * ```js
 * // The response has the following shape in event.detail:
 * {
 *     containerSelector: "container-component_A",
 *     name: "component_A",
 *     tabSelector: "tab-component_A",
 *     topic: "openfin-DOM-event",
 *     type: "tab-created",
 *     uuid: "OpenFin POC"
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * #### container-created
 * Generated when a container is created.  A single view will have only one container during its lifetime attached to a single window and the container's lifecycle is tied to the view.  To discover when the container is destroyed, please listen to view-detached event.
 * ```js
 * // The response has the following shape in event.detail:
 * {
 *     containerSelector: "container-component_A",
 *     name: "component_A",
 *     tabSelector: "tab-component_A",
 *     topic: "openfin-DOM-event",
 *     type: "container-created",
 *     uuid: "OpenFin POC"
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### layout-state-changed
 * Generated when the state of the layout changes in any way, such as a view added/removed/replaced. Note that this event can fire frequently as the underlying layout can change multiple components from all kinds of changes (resizing for example). Given this, it is recommended to debounce this event and then you can use the {@link Layout#getConfig Layout.getConfig} API to retrieve the most up-to-date state.
 * ```js
 * // The response has the following shape in event.detail
 * {
 *     containerSelector: "container-component_A",
 *     name: "component_A",
 *     tabSelector: "tab-component_A",
 *     topic: "openfin-DOM-event",
 *     type: "layout-state-changed",
 *     uuid: "OpenFin POC"
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * #### tab-closed
 * Generated when a tab is closed.
 * ```js
 * // The response has the following shape in event.detail:
 * {
 *     containerSelector: "container-component_A",
 *     name: "component_A",
 *     tabSelector: "tab-component_A",
 *     topic: "openfin-DOM-event",
 *     type: "tab-closed",
 *     uuid: "OpenFin POC",
 *     url: "http://openfin.co"   // The url of the view that was closed.
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * #### tab-dropped
 * Generated when a tab is dropped.
 * ```js
 * // The response has the following shape in event.detail:
 * {
 *     containerSelector: "container-component_A",
 *     name: "component_A",
 *     tabSelector: "tab-component_A",
 *     topic: "openfin-DOM-event",
 *     type: "tab-dropped",
 *     uuid: "OpenFin POC",
 *     url: "http://openfin.co"    // The url of the view linked to the dropped tab.
 * }
 * ```

	/**
	 * {@link https://developers.openfin.co/of-docs/docs/enable-color-linking}
	 *
	 * The Interop Broker is responsible for keeping track of the Interop state of the Platform, and for directing messages to the proper locations.
	 *
	 * @remarks This class contains some types related to FDC3 that are specific to OpenFin. {@link https://developers.openfin.co/of-docs/docs/fdc3-support-in-openfin OpenFin's FDC3 support} is forward- and backward-compatible.
	 * Standard types for {@link https://fdc3.finos.org/ FDC3} do not appear in OpenFin’s API documentation, to avoid duplication.
	 *
	 * ---
	 *
	 * There are 2 ways to inject custom functionality into the Interop Broker:
	 *
	 * **1. Configuration**
	 *
	 * At the moment, you can configure the default context groups for the Interop Broker without having to override it. To do so, include the `interopBrokerConfiguration` `contextGroups` option in your `platform` options in your manifest. This is the preferred method.
	 * ```js
	 * {
	 *      "runtime": {
	 *          "arguments": "--v=1 --inspect",
	 *          "version": "alpha-v19"
	 *      },
	 *      "platform": {
	 *          "uuid": "platform_customization_local",
	 *          "applicationIcon": "https://openfin.github.io/golden-prototype/favicon.ico",
	 *          "autoShow": false,
	 *          "providerUrl": "http://localhost:5555/provider.html",
	 *          "interopBrokerConfiguration": {
	 *              "contextGroups": [
	 *                  {
	 *                      "id": "green",
	 *                      "displayMetadata": {
	 *                          "color": "#00CC88",
	 *                          "name": "green"
	 *                      }
	 *                  },
	 *                  {
	 *                      "id": "purple",
	 *                      "displayMetadata": {
	 *                          "color": "#8C61FF",
	 *                          "name": "purple"
	 *                      }
	 *                  },
	 *              ]
	 *          }
	 *      }
	 * }
	 * ```
	 *
	 * By default the Interop Broker logs all actions to the console. You can disable this by using the logging option in `interopBrokerConfiguration`:
	 * ```js
	 * {
	 *      "runtime": {
	 *          "arguments": "--v=1 --inspect",
	 *          "version": "alpha-v19"
	 *      },
	 *      "platform": {
	 *          "uuid": "platform_customization_local",
	 *          "applicationIcon": "https://openfin.github.io/golden-prototype/favicon.ico",
	 *          "autoShow": false,
	 *          "providerUrl": "http://localhost:5555/provider.html",
	 *		    "interopBrokerConfiguration": {
	 *       		"logging": {
	 *   				"beforeAction": {
	 *   					"enabled": false
	 *   				},
	 *   				"afterAction": {
	 *   					"enabled": false
	 *   				}
	 *   			}
	 *		    }
	 *      }
	 * }
	 * ```
	 *
	 * ---
	 * **2. Overriding**
	 *
	 * Similarly to how {@link https://developers.openfin.co/docs/platform-customization#section-customizing-platform-behavior Platform Overriding} works, you can override functions in the Interop Broker in `fin.Platform.init`. An example of that is shown below. Overriding `isConnectionAuthorized` and `isActionAuthorized` will allow you to control allowed connections and allowed actions.
	 *
	 * However, if there is custom functionality you wish to include in the Interop Broker, please let us know. We would like to provide better configuration options so that you don't have to continually maintain your own override code.
	 *
	 * ```js
	 * fin.Platform.init({
	 *     overrideCallback: async (Provider) => {
	 *         class Override extends Provider {
	 *             async getSnapshot() {
	 *                 console.log('before getSnapshot')
	 *                 const snapshot = await super.getSnapshot();
	 *                 console.log('after getSnapshot')
	 *                 return snapshot;
	 *             }
	 *
	 *             async applySnapshot({ snapshot, options }) {
	 *                 console.log('before applySnapshot')
	 *                 const originalPromise = super.applySnapshot({ snapshot, options });
	 *                 console.log('after applySnapshot')
	 *
	 *                 return originalPromise;
	 *             }
	 *         };
	 *         return new Override();
	 *     },
	 *     interopOverride: async (InteropBroker) => {
	 *         class Override extends InteropBroker {
	 *             async joinContextGroup(channelName = 'default', target) {
	 *                 console.log('before super joinContextGroup')
	 *                 super.joinContextGroup(channelName, target);
	 *                 console.log('after super joinContextGroup')
	 *             }
	 *         }
	 *
	 *       return new Override();
	 *   }
	 * });
	 * ```
	 *
	 * ---

	     * to resolving it, like a specific app the client wants the context to be handled by. The clientIdentity is the identity
	     * of the client that made the call.
	     *
	     * To make this call FDC3-Compliant it would need to return an IntentResolution:
	     *
	     * ```js
	     * // {
	     * //     intent: { name: "StartChat", displayName: "Chat" },
	     * //     apps: [{ name: "Skype" }, { name: "Symphony" }, { name: "Slack" }]
	     * // }
	     * ```
	     *
	     * More information on the IntentResolution type can be found in the [FDC3 documentation](https://fdc3.finos.org/docs/api/ref/Metadata#intentresolution).

/**
 * The Interop Client API is broken up into two groups:
 *
 * **Content Facing APIs** - For Application Developers putting Views into a Platform Window, who care about Context. These are APIs that send out and receive the Context data that flows between applications. Think of this as the Water in the Interop Pipes.
 *
 * **Context Grouping APIs** - For Platform Developers, to add and remove Views to and from Context Groups. These APIs are utilized under-the-hood in Platforms, so they don't need to be used to participate in Interop. These are the APIs that decide which entities the context data flows between. Think of these as the valves or pipes that control the flow of Context Data for Interop.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * All APIs are available at the `fin.me.interop` namespace.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **You only need 2 things to participate in Interop Context Grouping:**
 * * A Context Handler for incoming context: {@link InteropClient#addContextHandler addContextHandler(handler, contextType?)}
 * * Call setContext on your context group when you want to share context with other group members: {@link InteropClient#setContext setContext(context)}

    /**
     * Creates a `lodash` object which wraps `value` to enable implicit method
     * chain sequences. Methods that operate on and return arrays, collections,
     * and functions can be chained together. Methods that retrieve a single value
     * or may return a primitive value will automatically end the chain sequence
     * and return the unwrapped value. Otherwise, the value must be unwrapped
     * with `_#value`.
     *
     * Explicit chain sequences, which must be unwrapped with `_#value`, may be
     * enabled using `_.chain`.
     *
     * The execution of chained methods is lazy, that is, it's deferred until
     * `_#value` is implicitly or explicitly called.
     *
     * Lazy evaluation allows several methods to support shortcut fusion.
     * Shortcut fusion is an optimization to merge iteratee calls; this avoids
     * the creation of intermediate arrays and can greatly reduce the number of
     * iteratee executions. Sections of a chain sequence qualify for shortcut
     * fusion if the section is applied to an array and iteratees accept only
     * one argument. The heuristic for whether a section qualifies for shortcut
     * fusion is subject to change.
     *
     * Chaining is supported in custom builds as long as the `_#value` method is
     * directly or indirectly included in the build.
     *
     * In addition to lodash methods, wrappers have `Array` and `String` methods.
     *
     * The wrapper `Array` methods are:
     * `concat`, `join`, `pop`, `push`, `shift`, `sort`, `splice`, and `unshift`
     *
     * The wrapper `String` methods are:
     * `replace` and `split`
     *
     * The wrapper methods that support shortcut fusion are:
     * `at`, `compact`, `drop`, `dropRight`, `dropWhile`, `filter`, `find`,
     * `findLast`, `head`, `initial`, `last`, `map`, `reject`, `reverse`, `slice`,
     * `tail`, `take`, `takeRight`, `takeRightWhile`, `takeWhile`, and `toArray`
     *
     * The chainable wrapper methods are:
     * `after`, `ary`, `assign`, `assignIn`, `assignInWith`, `assignWith`, `at`,
     * `before`, `bind`, `bindAll`, `bindKey`, `castArray`, `chain`, `chunk`,
