/**
 * Namespace for OpenFin event types. Each entity that emits OpenFin events has its own sub-namespace. Event payloads

 *
 * #### Event emitters
 *
 * The following entities emit OpenFin events, and have corresponding sub-namespaces:
 *
 * * {@link OpenFin.Application}: {@link OpenFin.ApplicationEvents}
 * * {@link OpenFin.ExternalApplication}: {@link OpenFin.ExternalApplicationEvents}
 * * {@link OpenFin.Frame}: {@link OpenFin.FrameEvents}
 * * {@link OpenFin.GlobalHotkey}: {@link OpenFin.GlobalHotkeyEvents}
 * * {@link OpenFin.Platform}: {@link OpenFin.PlatformEvents}
 * * {@link OpenFin.System}: {@link OpenFin.SystemEvents}
 * * {@link OpenFin.View}: {@link OpenFin.ViewEvents}
 * * {@link OpenFin.Window}: {@link OpenFin.WindowEvents}
 *
 * These `EventEmitter` entities share a common set of methods for interacting with the OpenFin event bus, which can be
 * seen on the individual documentation pages for each entity type.
 *
 * Registering event handlers is an asynchronous operation. It is important to ensure that the returned Promises are awaited to reduce the
 * risk of race conditions.
 *
 * When the `EventEmitter` receives an event from the browser process and emits on the renderer, all of the functions attached to that
 * specific event are called synchronously. Any values returned by the called listeners are ignored and will be discarded.  If the window document
 * is destroyed by page navigation or reload, its registered event listeners will be removed.
 *
 * We recommend using Arrow Functions for event listeners to ensure the this scope is consistent with the original function context.
 *
 * Events re-propagate from smaller/more-local scopes to larger/more-global scopes.  For example, an event emitted on a specific
 * view will propagate to the window in which the view is embedded, and then to the application in which the window is running, and
 * finally to the OpenFin runtime itself at the "system" level.  For details on propagation semantics, see the namespace for
 * the propagating (or propagated-to) entity.
 *
 * If you need the payload type for a specific type of event (especially propagated events), use the emitting topic's `Payload` generic
 * (e.g. {@link WindowEvents.Payload}) with the event's `type` string.  For example, the payload of
 * a {@link ViewEvents.CreatedEvent} after it has propagated to its parent {@link WindowEvents Window} can be found with
 * `WindowEvents.Payload<'view-created'>`.

 *
 * It is important to keep in mind that when an ordinary listener function is called, the standard `this` keyword is intentionally

 * then to the application as "window-view-shown", and finally at the system level as "application-window-view-shown".
 *
 * All event propagations are visible at the System level, regardless of source, so transitive re-propagations (e.g. from view to window
 * to application) are visible in their entirety at the system level.  So, we can listen to the above event as "shown", "view-shown",

     *
     * Create a popup window as a modal:
     *
     * Note: The only way to ensure true modal behavior is to create the window being shown as a popup with a

     * }
     * ```
     *
     * Listener callback:

     * //This response has the following shape:
     * {
     *     topic: "exited", // Or "released" on a call to releaseExternalProcess

     *     exitCode: 0 // Process exit code
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * By specifying a lifetime, an external process can live as long the window/application that launched it or
     * persist after the application exits. The default value is null, which is equivalent to 'persist', meaning
     * the process lives on after the application exits:
     *
     * ```js
     * fin.System.launchExternalProcess({

     * ```
     *
     * Note: A process that exits when the window/application exits cannot be released via fin.desktop.System.releaseExternalProcess.
     *
     * By specifying a cwd, it will set current working directory when launching an external process:
     *
     * ```js
     * fin.System.launchExternalProcess({
     *     path: 'cmd.exe',
     *     cwd: 'c:\\temp',

     * The Default Window's design can be customized by specifying the `stylesheetUrl` property in the manifest:
     *
     * ```json
     * {
     *     platform: {
     *         defaultWindowOptions: {
     *             stylesheetUrl: 'some-url.css',
     *             ...
     *         }
     *     }
     * }
     * ```
     * For a list of common Layout CSS classes you can override in your custom stylesheet, see <a href="tutorial-layoutStyles.html">Useful Layout CSS Classes</a>
     **
     * To specify a Platform Custom Window, provide a `url` property when creating a Window.
     * If you intend to render a Layout in your Custom Window, you must also specify an `HTMLElement` that the Layout will inject into and set its `id` property to `"layout-container"`.
     *
     * The example below will create a Platform Custom Window:
     *
     * ```js
     *     // in an OpenFin app:
     *     const platform = fin.Platform.getCurrentSync();
     *     const windowConfig =
     *         {
     *             url: "https://www.my-domain.com/my-custom-window.html", // here we point to where the Custom Frame is hosted.
     *             layout: {
     *                 content: [
     *                     {
     *                         type: "stack",
     *                         content: [
     *                             {
     *                                 type: "component",
     *                                 componentName: "view",
     *                                 componentState: {
     *                                     name: "app #1",
     *                                     url: "https://cdn.openfin.co/docs/javascript/canary/Platform.html"
     *                                 }
     *                             },
     *                             {
     *                                 type: "component",
     *                                 componentName: "view",
     *                                 componentState: {
     *                                     name: "app #2",
     *                                     url: "https://cdn.openfin.co/docs/javascript/canary/Platform.html"
     *                                 }
     *                             }
     *                         ]
     *                     }
     *                 ]
     *             }
     *         };
     *     platform.createWindow(windowConfig);
     * ```
     *
     * Here's an example of a minimalist Custom Platform Window implementation:
     * ```html
     * <html>
     *     <head>
     *         <meta charset="utf-8">
     *         <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
     *         <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./styles.css">
     *     </head>
     *     <body>
     *         <div id="of-frame-main">
     *             <div id="title-bar">
     *                 <div class="title-bar-draggable">
     *                     <div id="title"> This is a custom frame! </div>
     *                 </div>
     *                 <div id="buttons-wrapper">
     *                     <div class="button" id="minimize-button"></div>
     *                     <div class="button" id="expand-button"></div>
     *                     <div class="button" id="close-button"></div>
     *                 </div>
     *             </div>
     *             <div id="layout-container"></div> <!-- OpenFin layout would be injected here -->
     *             <script src="./custom-frame.js"></script>
     *         </div>
     *     </body>
     * </html>
     * ```
     * Your Custom Window can use in-domain resources for further customization (such as CSS, scripts, etc.).<br>
     * For a list of common Layout CSS classes you can override in your stylesheet, see <a href="tutorial-layoutStyles.html">Useful Layout CSS Classes</a>
     *
     * The example above will require the `body` element to have `height: 100%;` set in order to render the layout correctly.

 * You can use the built-in event emitter to listen to these events using [addEventListener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener).
 * The events are emitted synchronously and only in the process where the Layout exists.
 * Any values returned by the called listeners are ignored and will be discarded.
 * If the target DOM element is destroyed, any events that have been set up on that element will be destroyed.
 *
 * @remarks The built-in event emitter is not an OpenFin event emitter so it doesn't share propagation semantics.
 *
 * #### [addEventListener(type, listener [, options]);](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener)
 * Adds a listener to the end of the listeners array for the specified event.
 * @example
 * ```js
 * const myLayoutContainer = document.getElementById('layout-container');
 *
 * myLayoutContainer.addEventListener('tab-created', function(event) {
 *      const { tabSelector } = event.detail;
 *      const tabElement = document.getElementById(tabSelector);
 *      const existingColor = tabElement.style.backgroundColor;
 *      tabElement.style.backgroundColor = "red";
 *      setTimeout(() => {
 *          tabElement.style.backgroundColor = existingColor;
 *      }, 2000);
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * #### [removeEventListener(type, listener [, options]);](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/removeEventListener)
 * Adds a listener to the end of the listeners array for the specified event.
 * @example
 * ```js
 * const myLayoutContainer = document.getElementById('layout-container');
 *
 * const listener = function(event) {
 *     console.log(event.detail);
 *     console.log('container-created event fired once, removing listener');
 *     myLayoutContainer.removeEventListener('container-created', listener);
 * };
 *
 * myLayoutContainer.addEventListener('container-created', listener);
 * ```
 *
 * ### Supported event types are:
 *
 * * tab-created
 * * container-created
 * * layout-state-changed
 * * tab-closed
 * * tab-dropped
 *
 * ### Layout DOM Node Events
 *
 * #### tab-created
 * Generated when a tab is created.  As a user drags and drops tabs within window, new tabs are created.  A single view may have multiple tabs created and destroyed during its lifetime attached to a single window.
 * ```js
 * // The response has the following shape in event.detail:
 * {
 *     containerSelector: "container-component_A",
 *     name: "component_A",
 *     tabSelector: "tab-component_A",
 *     topic: "openfin-DOM-event",
 *     type: "tab-created",
 *     uuid: "OpenFin POC"
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * #### container-created
 * Generated when a container is created.  A single view will have only one container during its lifetime attached to a single window and the container's lifecycle is tied to the view.  To discover when the container is destroyed, please listen to view-detached event.
 * ```js
 * // The response has the following shape in event.detail:
 * {
 *     containerSelector: "container-component_A",
 *     name: "component_A",
 *     tabSelector: "tab-component_A",
 *     topic: "openfin-DOM-event",
 *     type: "container-created",
 *     uuid: "OpenFin POC"
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### layout-state-changed
 * Generated when the state of the layout changes in any way, such as a view added/removed/replaced. Note that this event can fire frequently as the underlying layout can change multiple components from all kinds of changes (resizing for example). Given this, it is recommended to debounce this event and then you can use the {@link Layout#getConfig Layout.getConfig} API to retrieve the most up-to-date state.
 * ```js
 * // The response has the following shape in event.detail
 * {
 *     containerSelector: "container-component_A",
 *     name: "component_A",
 *     tabSelector: "tab-component_A",
 *     topic: "openfin-DOM-event",
 *     type: "layout-state-changed",
 *     uuid: "OpenFin POC"
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * #### tab-closed
 * Generated when a tab is closed.
 * ```js
 * // The response has the following shape in event.detail:
 * {
 *     containerSelector: "container-component_A",
 *     name: "component_A",
 *     tabSelector: "tab-component_A",
 *     topic: "openfin-DOM-event",
 *     type: "tab-closed",
 *     uuid: "OpenFin POC",
 *     url: "http://openfin.co"   // The url of the view that was closed.
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * #### tab-dropped
 * Generated when a tab is dropped.
 * ```js
 * // The response has the following shape in event.detail:
 * {
 *     containerSelector: "container-component_A",
 *     name: "component_A",
 *     tabSelector: "tab-component_A",
 *     topic: "openfin-DOM-event",
 *     type: "tab-dropped",
 *     uuid: "OpenFin POC",
 *     url: "http://openfin.co"    // The url of the view linked to the dropped tab.
 * }
 * ```

/**
 * {@link https://developers.openfin.co/of-docs/docs/enable-color-linking}
 *
 * The Interop Broker is responsible for keeping track of the Interop state of the Platform, and for directing messages to the proper locations.
 *
 * @remarks This class contains some types related to FDC3 that are specific to OpenFin. {@link https://developers.openfin.co/of-docs/docs/fdc3-support-in-openfin OpenFin's FDC3 support} is forward- and backward-compatible.
 * Standard types for {@link https://fdc3.finos.org/ FDC3} do not appear in OpenFin’s API documentation, to avoid duplication.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * There are 2 ways to inject custom functionality into the Interop Broker:
 *
 * **1. Configuration**
 *
 * At the moment, you can configure the default context groups for the Interop Broker without having to override it. To do so, include the `interopBrokerConfiguration` `contextGroups` option in your `platform` options in your manifest. This is the preferred method.
 * ```js
 * {
 *      "runtime": {
 *          "arguments": "--v=1 --inspect",
 *          "version": "alpha-v19"
 *      },
 *      "platform": {
 *          "uuid": "platform_customization_local",
 *          "applicationIcon": "https://openfin.github.io/golden-prototype/favicon.ico",
 *          "autoShow": false,
 *          "providerUrl": "http://localhost:5555/provider.html",
 *          "interopBrokerConfiguration": {
 *              "contextGroups": [
 *                  {
 *                      "id": "green",
 *                      "displayMetadata": {
 *                          "color": "#00CC88",
 *                          "name": "green"
 *                      }
 *                  },
 *                  {
 *                      "id": "purple",
 *                      "displayMetadata": {
 *                          "color": "#8C61FF",
 *                          "name": "purple"
 *                      }
 *                  },
 *              ]
 *          }
 *      }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * By default the Interop Broker logs all actions to the console. You can disable this by using the logging option in `interopBrokerConfiguration`:
 * ```js
 * {
 *      "runtime": {
 *          "arguments": "--v=1 --inspect",
 *          "version": "alpha-v19"
 *      },
 *      "platform": {
 *          "uuid": "platform_customization_local",
 *          "applicationIcon": "https://openfin.github.io/golden-prototype/favicon.ico",
 *          "autoShow": false,
 *          "providerUrl": "http://localhost:5555/provider.html",
 *		    "interopBrokerConfiguration": {
 *       		"logging": {
 *   				"beforeAction": {
 *   					"enabled": false
 *   				},
 *   				"afterAction": {
 *   					"enabled": false
 *   				}
 *   			}
 *		    }
 *      }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ---
 * **2. Overriding**
 *
 * Similarly to how {@link https://developers.openfin.co/docs/platform-customization#section-customizing-platform-behavior Platform Overriding} works, you can override functions in the Interop Broker in `fin.Platform.init`. An example of that is shown below. Overriding `isConnectionAuthorized` and `isActionAuthorized` will allow you to control allowed connections and allowed actions.
 *
 * However, if there is custom functionality you wish to include in the Interop Broker, please let us know. We would like to provide better configuration options so that you don't have to continually maintain your own override code.
 *
 * ```js
 * fin.Platform.init({
 *     overrideCallback: async (Provider) => {
 *         class Override extends Provider {
 *             async getSnapshot() {
 *                 console.log('before getSnapshot')
 *                 const snapshot = await super.getSnapshot();
 *                 console.log('after getSnapshot')
 *                 return snapshot;
 *             }
 *
 *             async applySnapshot({ snapshot, options }) {
 *                 console.log('before applySnapshot')
 *                 const originalPromise = super.applySnapshot({ snapshot, options });
 *                 console.log('after applySnapshot')
 *
 *                 return originalPromise;
 *             }
 *         };
 *         return new Override();
 *     },
 *     interopOverride: async (InteropBroker) => {
 *         class Override extends InteropBroker {
 *             async joinContextGroup(channelName = 'default', target) {
 *                 console.log('before super joinContextGroup')

/**
 * The Interop Client API is broken up into two groups:
 *
 * **Content Facing APIs** - For Application Developers putting Views into a Platform Window, who care about Context. These are APIs that send out and receive the Context data that flows between applications. Think of this as the Water in the Interop Pipes.
 *
 * **Context Grouping APIs** - For Platform Developers, to add and remove Views to and from Context Groups. These APIs are utilized under-the-hood in Platforms, so they don't need to be used to participate in Interop. These are the APIs that decide which entities the context data flows between. Think of these as the valves or pipes that control the flow of Context Data for Interop.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * All APIs are available at the `fin.me.interop` namespace.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **You only need 2 things to participate in Interop Context Grouping:**
 * * A Context Handler for incoming context: {@link InteropClient#addContextHandler addContextHandler(handler, contextType?)}
 * * Call setContext on your context group when you want to share context with other group members: {@link InteropClient#setContext setContext(context)}
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ##### Constructor
 * Returned by {@link Interop.connectSync Interop.connectSync}.
 *

 *
 * ##### Interop methods intended for Views
 *
 *
 * **Context Groups API**
 *  * {@link InteropClient#addContextHandler addContextHandler(handler, contextType?)}
 *  * {@link InteropClient#setContext setContext(context)}
 *  * {@link InteropClient#getCurrentContext getCurrentContext(contextType?)}
 *  * {@link InteropClient#joinSessionContextGroup joinSessionContextGroup(sessionContextGroupId)}

 * @version 1.2
 * The FDC3 Client Library provides a set APIs to be used for FDC3 compliance,
 * while using our Interop API under the hood. In order to use this set of APIs
 * you will need to set up your own {@link InteropBroker InteropBroker} or use a Platform application, which does the setup for you. Refer to our documentation on
 * our {@link https://developers.openfin.co/of-docs/docs/enable-color-linking Interop API}.
 *
 * To enable the FDC3 APIs in a {@link Window Window} or {@link View View}, add the fdc3InteropApi
 * property to its options:
 *
 * ```js
 * {
 *     autoShow: false,
 *     saveWindowState: true,
 *     url: 'https://openfin.co',
 *     fdc3InteropApi: '1.2'
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * If using a {@link Platform Platform } application, you can set this property in defaultWindowOptions and defaultViewOptions.
 *
 * In order to ensure that the FDC3 Api is ready before use, you can use the 'fdc3Ready' event fired on the DOM Window object:
 *
 * ```js
 * function fdc3Action() {
 *     // Make some fdc3 API calls here
 * }
 *
 * if (window.fdc3) {
 *    fdc3Action();
 * } else {
 *    window.addEventListener('fdc3Ready', fdc3Action);

 * our {@link https://developers.openfin.co/of-docs/docs/enable-context-sharing Interop API}.
 *
 * To enable the FDC3 APIs in a {@link Window Window} or {@link View View}, add the fdc3InteropApi

 *     saveWindowState: true,
 *     url: 'https://openfin.co',
 *     fdc3InteropApi: '2.0'
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * If using a {@link Platform Platform } application, you can set this property in defaultWindowOptions and defaultViewOptions.
 *
 * In order to ensure that the FDC3 Api is ready before use, you can use the 'fdc3Ready' event fired on the DOM Window object:
 *
 * ```js
 * function fdc3Action() {
 *     // Make some fdc3 API calls here
