# Integrate with Microsoft Excel

This repository demonstrates how to use OpenFinâ€™s Excel integration in order to interact with the Microsoft Excel native client application. The Excel integration API is an ES module provided via the [@openfin/excel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openfin/excel) NPM package.

For further information about the Excel integration, refer to the developer [documentation](https://developers.openfin.co/of-docs/docs/excel-integration).

## How it Works

The excel.ts looks for a running version of Excel and will let you select an active workbook and worksheet. Then the application will monitor changes to the cells in Excel and display all of them. If at any point the application sees one of the known instruments it will broadcast it as an FDC3 instrument.

The secondary fdc3monitor.ts will monitor for the FDC3 instrument messages.
