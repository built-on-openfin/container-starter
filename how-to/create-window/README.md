# Open different types of windows

## How it Works

The app.ts listens for button clicks and creates with a dynamic openfin window or from a manifest. 

The manifest is located in the config folder along with the manifest for this sample application.

## Get Started

Follow the instructions below to get up and running.

### Set up the project

1. Install dependencies. Note that these examples assume you are in the sub-directory for the example.

```bash
$ npm install
```

2. Build the project.

```bash
$ npm run build
```

3. Start the test server in a new window.

```bash
$ npm run start
```

4. Start the Platform application.

```bash
$ npm run client
```

### What you will see

1. The default platform provider window (as the manifest sets autoshow to true to help with development)
