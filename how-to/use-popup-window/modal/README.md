[![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-canary-yellow.svg)](https://shields.io/)

**Note**: this feature is available for development purposes only and will be officially released in v26.

## How it Works

The `client/src/app.ts` sets up a button that when clicked will create a popup window that is a modal by passing the platform window identity as `initialOptions.modalParentIdentity`.
