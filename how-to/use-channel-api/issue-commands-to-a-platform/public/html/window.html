		<p>
			This is a basic window app to represent an external app issuing commands to a platform to launch a view.
			This app could be a java or a .net application as well as a web based application.
		</p>
		<p>The buttons below let you:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Launch a platform app and connect to the command channel</li>
			<li>Send a command to the platform to launch a view and pass some data</li>
			<li>
				Send a command to the platform to launch a view, pass some data and tell it to place the view near a
				specific window/view (in this case the last one launched)
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			When the platform is launched you will see the provider window show (it is generally hidden by default).
			Once shown you can issue the createView commands from this application.
