<body>
This is a basic window app to represent an external app issuing commands to a platform to launch a view. This app could be a java or a .net application as well as a web based application.
<p>
    The buttons below let you:
    <ul>
        <li>Launch a platform app</li>
        <li>Send a command to the platform to launch a view and pass some data</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>When the platform is launched you will see the provider window show (it is generally hidden by default). Once shown you can issue the createView commands from this application.</p>
