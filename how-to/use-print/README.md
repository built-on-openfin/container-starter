# Use Print

## How it Works

This example demonstrates how to use the `view.print()` function to print the current window's child views. The app contains a button that triggers the print dialog when clicked.

For more information, see the [OpenFin View.print documentation](https://developer.openfin.co/docs/javascript/stable/classes/OpenFin.View.html#print).

## Get Started

Follow the instructions below to get up and running.

### Set up the project

1. Install dependencies and do the initial build. Note that these examples assume you are in the sub-directory for the example.

```shell
npm run setup
```

2. Build the project.

```shell
npm run build
```

3. Start the test server in a new window.

```shell
npm run start
```

4. Start the Platform application.

```shell
npm run client
```

### What you will see

1. A platform window with two example views and a print button
2. Clicking the print button will open the system print dialog
3. The view content will be available for printing
