# Add Analytics to your Application

These are examples of leveraging OpenFin's [System API](https://developer.openfin.co/docs/javascript/stable/System.html), to show you how you can setup your own live metrics for your OpenFin enhanced applications. For a detailed perspective of implementation details please see our page on [OpenFin Web Analytics](https://developers.openfin.co/of-docs/docs/openfin-analytics-options).

### PLEASE NOTE
> These are demo applications for learning and are not meant for production use. Please use this as a way of seeing how you might approach adding analytics to your application. These examples assume you have already [set up your development environment](https://developers.openfin.co/of-docs/docs/set-up-your-dev-environment).
