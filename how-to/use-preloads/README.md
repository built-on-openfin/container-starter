## What you can do with this repository

This repository contains examples showing how to setup preload scripts as well as some examples on how they can be used.

### Examples

  | Example         | Description |
|---------------------|------------------------------------
| [How To - Hello World](./hello-world) | This is an example of how to wire up preloads to the different parts of an OpenFin application. If you just want to know how to add a preload script then this is the simplest example (each preload simply console.logs a message)      
| [How To - Restart On Refresh](./restart-on-refresh) | This is an example of how to wire up a preload script that checks the urls a view navigates to and if the page is reloaded/refreshed then it navigates back to the original url
