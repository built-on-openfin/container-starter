# Use dynamic manifest

This repository demonstrates how to return different manifests depending on url query string.

---

## How it Works

The index.ts file in the src folder is used by the express server to return different manifest json depending supplied query string.

Query strings:
    env=staging - staging environment
    env=dev - dev environment
---
Following npm commands in the package.json perform the above commands:
npm run staging
    "staging" :"start fin://localhost:8080/?env=staging"

npm run dev
    "dev" :"start fin://localhost:8080/?env=dev"

## Get Started

Follow the instructions below to get up and running.

### Set up the project

1. Install dependencies. Note that these examples assume you are in the sub-directory for the example.

```bash
$ npm install
```

2. Build the project.

```bash
$ npm run build
```

3. Start the test server in a new window.

```bash
$ npm run start
```

for proceeding steps start another terminal in the same location

4. Start the Platform staging application.

$ npm run staging
```

5. Start the Platform dev application.

```bash
$ npm run dev
```
### What you will see

When dev is used the app-dev.html will open in a new window and the same for staging with app-staging.html.
