It is built on top of Google Chromium and GitHub Electron and combines advanced interoperability, lightning-fast distribution, and robust security with an agile web development and deployment model.

## Examples

| **Example** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| [platform-api-seed](https://github.com/openfin/platform-api-project-seed) | Needs dissection, ts refactor? |
| [navigation-changed](https://github.com/adam-saland/navigation-changed) | Demonstrates the use of events to detect navigational changes from the context of a view and react to them in the context of a window. |
| [launch-external](https://github.com/adam-saland/launch-external) | Demonstrates the use of a secure api, and application asset execution from within the context of a window. |
| add-analytics-to-container-project/basic [add-analytics-to-container-project/advanced](https://github.com/adam-saland/container-starter/tree/main/how-to/add-analytics-to-your-application) | Using openfin’s recommended api’s for analytics this guide demonstrates posting application metrics via the use of commonly used industry analytics tools: elasticsearch and kibana using a docker container as the server environment. |
| [openfin-headless-app-template](https://github.com/johnman/openfin-headless-app-template) | The goal of this template is to show how to build something agent like. It does not have a UI and some config files set it up so that it autostarts on login. It also gives a basic example of a client sdk and two test apps that use that sdk. ** Needs a more clearly defined use case/story |
| [openfin-puppeteer](https://github.com/connormccafferty/openfin-puppeteer) | Needs work |
